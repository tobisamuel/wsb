              The causes that have the greatest impact on burnout are very
              individual, they depend both on the personality and work
              environment of a given person. <br />
              <br /> Reasons directly related to a given person may be:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-6">

              Burnout symptoms - how to recognize them?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Burnout is most often described as exhaustion. According to
              Christina Maslach, we can consider them in three different
              contexts:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-6">
              <li>
                emotional: discouragement to work, pessimism, chronic fatigue,
              </li>
              <li>
                interpersonal: distance in contacts with the environment, less
                sensitivity to others,
              </li>
              <li>
                cognitive: dissatisfaction with your job, loss of confidence in
                your own abilities.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The hardest part is that it&#39;s hard to tell when a person&#39;s
              burnout begins because it starts very slowly and imperceptibly,
              then speeds up and increases in intensity to produce new symptoms.
